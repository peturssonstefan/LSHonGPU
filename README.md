# LSHonGPU
LSH algorithms implemented both as sketches and (K,L) parameterized framework for an Nvidia GPU using CUDA C/C++

The actual LSH implementation files can be found in the LinearScan folder.
The DataParsing folder was used as preprocessing. 
The Goldstandard is c++ CPU implementations for calculating Goldstandards. 
Plotting contains python files to generate the different plots.
